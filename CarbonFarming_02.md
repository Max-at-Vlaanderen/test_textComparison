Carbon farming is a set of agricultural practices and strategies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhancing carbon sequestration in soils and landscapes. It involves land management techniques that help mitigate climate change by capturing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, while also providing various environmental and economic co-benefits. In the European Union (EU), carbon farming is increasingly recognized as a key component of climate action policies, particularly within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) framework.

### Key Components of Carbon Farming

1. **Definition and Approach:**
   - Carbon farming can be implemented through two main approaches: action-based and result-based payments. Action-based schemes pay farmers for adopting specific practices, such as agroforestry or organic farming, that are expected to reduce emissions or sequester carbon. Result-based schemes, on the other hand, tie payments directly to measured outcomes, such as verified reductions in GHG emissions or increases in soil carbon stocks ([Source: T14_IPOL_STU(2021)695482_EN, Page 10]).

2. **European Policy Context:**
   - The EU’s CAP has been criticized for not adequately reducing carbon emissions, but the new CAP legislation requires Member States to prioritize climate action in their Strategic Plans. This includes funding initiatives that support carbon farming practices through both public and private financing mechanisms ([Source: T14_IPOL_STU(2021)695482_EN, Page 13]).

3. **Co-benefits of Carbon Farming:**
   - Beyond climate mitigation, carbon farming often delivers additional benefits such as improved biodiversity, enhanced water quality, and increased resilience to climate change. For example, practices like agroforestry can diversify income streams for farmers while reducing costs associated with sustainable land management ([Source: T14_setting up and implementing... Page 121]).

4. **Quantitative Potential:**
   - The effectiveness of carbon farming varies depending on factors such as soil type, climatic conditions, and existing management practices. In specific contexts, such as peatland restoration, the potential for climate mitigation is particularly high, with significant GHG emission reductions per unit area ([Source: T14_setting up and implementing... Page 122]).

5. **Challenges and Considerations:**
   - Implementing carbon farming at scale requires overcoming barriers such as the costs of developing result-based payment schemes, the need for robust monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems, and addressing concerns about carbon leakage ([Source: T14_setting up and implementing... Page 10]).

### Conclusion

Carbon farming represents a promising approach to aligning agricultural practices with climate goals, offering both environmental and economic benefits. By targeting specific regions and practices, the EU can maximize the effectiveness of carbon farming while supporting farmers in their transition to more sustainable land management systems.
