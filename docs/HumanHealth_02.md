Soil health plays a crucial role in human well-being through several key pathways: food security, water quality, disease prevention, and climate resilience. Here's how soil health influences human health, supported by relevant references and European policy connections:

### 1. Food Security and Nutrition
Healthy soils are essential for nutrient-rich crops, which directly impact human nutrition. The FAO report (2017) highlights that maintaining soil organic matter levels is vital for food security. Poor soil health can lead to reduced crop yields, with studies showing a potential decrease of 10-25% in productivity (Nielsen et al., 2016). This underscores the importance of sustainable agricultural practices to ensure access to nutritious food.

### 2. Water Quality and Safety
Soil acts as a natural filter for water, preventing contaminants from entering water supplies. The European Environment Agency (2020) emphasizes that soil degradation can lead to polluted water sources. In the EU, 38% of citizens rely on groundwater, making soil health critical for safe drinking water as per WHO guidelines.

### 3. Disease Prevention
Soil biota play a role in decomposition and nutrient cycling, which helps suppress plant diseases. Degraded soils may lack these beneficial organisms, potentially leading to higher pesticide use and associated human health risks (European Green Deal). EU initiatives like the 4 per 1000 program aim to enhance soil organic matter by 4‰ annually, promoting healthier ecosystems.

### 4. Climate Resilience
Soils sequester carbon, mitigating climate change impacts on agriculture and food systems. The European Green Deal supports research into soil carbon sequestration through projects like CIRCASA, which aligns with global efforts to enhance agricultural soils' carbon retention, benefiting both the environment and human health.

### Conclusion
Soil health is intricately linked to human well-being, supported by EU policies that promote sustainable land management. By understanding and addressing soil health, we can enhance food security, ensure safe water supplies, prevent diseases, and build climate resilience, all of which are vital for human health.
