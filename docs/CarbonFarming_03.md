Carbon farming refers to agricultural practices aimed at capturing and storing [soil carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soil_carbon) dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere in soil and vegetation. This approach not only helps mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas levels but also enhances soil health and productivity.

The European Union has emphasized the importance of carbon farming through various initiatives. For instance, the communication titled ‘Sustainable Carbon Cycles’ highlights the need for clear identification of activities that effectively remove carbon from the atmosphere. This includes developing a framework for certifying carbon removals from natural ecosystems, particularly soils.

Additionally, the EU Mission ‘A Soil Deal for Europe’ aims to provide funding for real-life sites to test and upscale carbon farming solutions. Regulation (EU) 2018/841 underscores the significance of soil carbon in achieving climate neutrality goals and mandates Member States to monitor soil carbon stocks using datasets like the land use/cover area frame statistical survey (LUCAS).

In the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), land and soil are recognized as both sources and sinks of carbon, and the EU and its Member States are committed to promoting sustainable management and enhancement of these carbon reservoirs.
